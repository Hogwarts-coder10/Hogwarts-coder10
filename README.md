# Hi, I'm V SS Karthik 👋

**I build things that shouldn't work, then I make them fast.**

From deep-level database internals to making AI explain itself, I live in the "how does this actually work?" phase of development. I'm a Python native currently wrestling JavaScript into submission to bring my projects to the web.

### 🛠 What I'm up to:
* 🗄️ **Custom DB Server**: Architected a database engine from the ground up using **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** for atomic integrity.
* 🔍 **GlassBoxML**: Building a toolkit to turn "Black Box" machine learning into transparent, interpretable models.
* 🎨 **DSAViz (Loading...)**: My next mission. An interactive visualizer for Data Structures and Algorithms because logic should look as cool as it feels.

### 🧠 My Stack:
* **Languages:** Python (Fluent), JavaScript (Learning/Building)
* **Interests:** Database Internals, ML Interpretability, Systems Design

> "Low-level logic, high-level curiosity."
