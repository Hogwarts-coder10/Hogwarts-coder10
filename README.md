🪄 Hi, I'm V SS Karthik
I build things that shouldn't work, then I make them fast. I’m a Python developer currently wrestling JavaScript into submission. From deep-level database internals to making AI explain itself, I live in the "how does this actually work?" phase of development.

🛠️ What’s in the Cauldron?
🗄️ WAL-DB: A custom database engine built from scratch using Write-Ahead Logging for atomic integrity.

🔍 GlassBoxML: Bringing light to "Black Box" machine learning with interpretability tools.

🎨 DSAViz: (Brewing) An interactive visualizer to make Data Structures & Algorithms visible.

🧠 The Spellbook (Stack)
Languages: Python (Mastered), JavaScript (Apprentice)

Interests: Database Internals, ML Interpretability, Systems Design
